# Hierarchical Navigation Test Guide

## Testing the Hierarchical Navigation System

### 1. Basic Navigation
- ✅ Start the application - should see "__ Universe" start node
- ✅ Click on "__ Universe" - should transition to "My Universe" (techno node)
- ✅ Click the navigation menu button (⚡) - should open the navigation graph

### 2. Sub-Graph Navigation
- Click on the "My Universe" node (techno) when it's the current node
  - Should see expansion animation (background circle with yellow theme)
  - Should enter the techno sub-graph with nodes: "Deep Universe" and "Quantum Layer"
  - Should show navigation path breadcrumb at the top

### 3. Engineering Sub-Graph Navigation  
- Navigate to "Engineering Cosmos" node first
- Click on "Engineering Cosmos" when it's the current node
  - Should enter engineering sub-graph with nodes: "Mechanical Design", "Electronics", "Software"
  - Should show updated navigation path

### 4. Exit Sub-Graph Navigation
- When in a sub-graph, click outside the circular boundary (120px radius from center)
  - Should exit back to parent graph
  - Should restore previous navigation state

### 5. Visual Features to Test
- ✅ Sub-graph indicator dots around nodes that have sub-graphs (3 white dots)
- ✅ Background expansion animation when entering sub-graphs
- ✅ Navigation path breadcrumb display
- ✅ Circular boundary detection for exit functionality

### Current Status
The hierarchical navigation system has been implemented with:
- ✅ Memory graph structure with nested sub-graphs
- ✅ Navigation state management (navigationPath, currentGraphLevel)
- ✅ Sub-graph entry/exit functions
- ✅ Visual expansion animations
- ✅ Sub-graph indicator dots
- ✅ Click-outside-to-exit functionality

### Known Issues to Address
- Exit animation (reverse of expansion) needs implementation
- Generic sub-graph node renderer may need refinement
- Testing on all navigation paths
